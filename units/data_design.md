  Learning how to design relational data with interlinked tables

Goal: to create a data design that represents the information contained in this catalog of an auction of paintings:

<https://archive.org/details/catalogueofhighl00chri/page/n13/mode/2up>

Working as a group or solo, first select potential research goals. Some possibilities include:

1. Track which artists, or nationalities/regions of artists commanded the highest or the lowest prices. (hint: the handwritten three-part numbers represent British sterling, represented as `pounds.shillings.pence`)
2. Identify recurring words or rhetorical strategies used by the auction authors, and whether they are associated with the type of artwork or the nationality of the artist
3. Trace connections between artists made by the catalog authors when, in describing the work of one artist, they mention the name of another.
4.

Goal: with your group, work out a data design that represents the sales of artworks in this auction catalog.
