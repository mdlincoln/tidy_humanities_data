## [OpenRefine Tutorial](https://doi.org/10.46430/phen0023)

Tips on following the tutorial:

1. **Make sure to import the data properly according to the tutorial instructions** - they walk you through adjusting some of the default import settings to read the data correctly. If you miss this, then a lot of the following steps will give very different results than are shown in the tutorial.
2. Remember to click the "Remove All" button under the "Facet / Filter" menu between steps. This doesn't remove data, it just removes the facet view, letting you start fresh with the next step in the tutorial.
3. While the `Split multi-valued cells...` command is crucial for many data cleaning operations in OpenRefine, remember to `Join multi-valued cells...` again before exporting a CSV of your tidied data.

This tutorial only covers a small portion of what OpenRefine can do. A more complete tutorial is available from [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-open-refine/). I particularly recommend the [reconciliation services](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-open-refine/13-looking-up-data/index.html#reconciliation-services)
